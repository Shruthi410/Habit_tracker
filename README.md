# Habit_tracker

Organize Your Life! This is the most powerful companion to keep track of your day to day habits and routines. A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X.
